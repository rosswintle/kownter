# Kownter - Simple, private, self-hosted, cookie free website analytics...one day...maybe

_I’m going on the journey of building a simple, private, self-hosted, cookie-free analytics
tool that I’m calling Kownter. I may fail. But it will be fun and interesting! Come along!_

### Warning: this is very early-alpha software. It does a simple job, but it could all change
in quite big ways. Feel free to try it out, but please don't use it for any real analytics
that you actually need to depend upon.

## About Kownter

Kownter is a self-hosted website analytics tool that:

* does not use cookies;
* collects zero personal data (except IPs in server logs, if you do that);
* is really simple.

It partly exists to explore what can be done without cookies. And this is its biggest limitation: tracking of user's journeys through a site will be very limited, as will tracking
return users.
